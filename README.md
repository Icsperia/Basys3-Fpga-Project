Basys3 VGA Mini-Game Project

This project implements a simple VGA-based mini-game on the Basys3 FPGA development board. The game features a bouncing ball and two player-controlled paddles, similar to a minimal version of Pong.
Features

    Full HD VGA Output (1920×1080):
    Custom VGA driver outputs Full HD video using a 148.5 MHz pixel clock generated by a PLL.

    Game Objects:

        Two movable rectangles (paddles) located on the left and right sides of the screen

        One autonomous circle (ball) that bounces within the screen boundaries

    Game Mechanics:

        The ball moves automatically, bouncing off the top and bottom edges of the screen

        Players can move paddles up and down using the onboard buttons

        If the ball touches a paddle, it resets to its initial starting position

Modules

    VGA Driver:
    Generates VGA timing signals for 1080p resolution

    PLL (Phase-Locked Loop):
    Provides the required 148.5 MHz clock for VGA pixel timing

    Shape Renderer:
    Draws two paddles and a circle using simple pixel logic

    Delay Module:
    Used to control the update rate of the ball and paddle movements, acting as a frame limiter

    Collision Detection:
    Resets the ball position upon contact with a paddle

Controls

    Onboard Basys3 buttons are used to move the paddles up and down

    The ball moves independently without user input
